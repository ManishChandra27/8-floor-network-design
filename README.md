# 8-floor-network-design
A Cisco Packet Tracer project implementing dynamic routing (RIP) for an 8-floor office using hybrid, mesh, and bus topologies, with DHCP, DNS, FTP, and Mail services.
# 8-Floor Network Design

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a network infrastructure for an 8-floor office building using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Features:
- Unique topologies for each set of floors:
  - Floors 1-3: Hybrid topology
  - Floors 4-6: Mesh topology
  - Floors 7-8: Bus topology
- FLSM-based IPv4 Addressing (199.168.11.0/29)
- RIP Dynamic Routing across 4 routers
- Network Services:
  - DHCP Server (5th Floor)
  - DNS Server (6th Floor)
  - FTP Server (7th Floor)
  - Mail Server (8th Floor)

## Tools Used:
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Microsoft Word
- GitHub

## Setup Instructions:
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Verify each floor’s topology and PC connectivity.
3. Ensure RIP routing is enabled and servers are configured.
4. Refer to the attached Word document for IP details and topology screenshots.
